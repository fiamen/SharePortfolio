# SharePortfolio

This project has selected 21 shares to allocate to an optimal portfolio of share among 90 companies listed on the Australian stock 
exchange 200.
The portfolio theory has been used  to determine the proportion of the shares to minimise the risk and maximise the return.
The  monthly real rate of return for the portfolio has approximated the predicted average monthly returned.
